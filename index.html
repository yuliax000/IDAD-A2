            These two websites are quite similar. The idea of these two websites
            is clicking on different parts of the screen will produce different
            sound and different animations, which provides quite engaging
            experience.

          <h2>Conceptual response</h2>
          <p>
            My concept is a no text website that generating some random sounds
            and ripples or colorful circles based on the mouse click coordinates
            of the user. This website aims to create an engaging interactive
            experience by integrating user actions, visuals and auditory
            elements. The x-axis represents the pitch variation, the y-axis
            represents the filter change, and the generated sound waveforms on
            the website are random (the visual part must be random as well). The
            website needs to have a pause button to stop the sound for a while,
            a button to reset all the settings and a volume slider. The website
            should focus more on intuitive and reduce instruction to let the
            users explore the website by themselves. It's important to consider
            how to attract users to explore the website actively.

          <h2>Implementation and system map</h2>
          <div id="systemMap">
            <p>
              the technique I chose is using addeventlistener to trigger mouse
              action. Create a pad of the same size as the window to monitor the
              x and y coordinates of the mouse. Use Math.random() to select a
              random wavetype. Every time the mouse is clicked, a new oscillator
              is created and connected to a new filter. Their values are
              determined by the mouse position. By calculating the ratio of the
              coordinates to the window size, it gives a value specific to these
              coordinates. Use setValueAtTime(value, starttime) to monitor the
              current mouse value, and update the corresponding value each time
              the mouse moves, achieving the effect of dragging and sound
              variation. To achieve the fade-out effect of the sound,
              exponentialRampToValueAtTime(value, endtime) is used. And stop()
              is used to set the duration of the sound extension.
            </p>

            <p>
              e.stopPropagation() prevents the area at the bottom of the button
              from triggering the sound. The setting of the "pause button" is as
              follows: when the mouse is clicked, it checks whether the
              audioContext is running. If it is running, it switches the play
              icon to the pause icon, then suspend it; if it is paused, it
              switches the pause icon to the play icon, then re-open it. The
              setting for the "reset button" is as follows: After clicking with
              the mouse, it closes the currently running audioContext, then
              creates a brand new one and resets the volume to the default
              level. The "volume slider" links the current value clicked by the
              mouse with the volume.

          <h2>Feedback setting (before peer user testing)</h2>
          <p>
            I tried to enhance the interactive feedback. Inverting the image of
            buttons while clicking on the button. For the red dot, it changes
            into a slightly deeper red while clicking and dragging
          </p>

          <h2>reflection on peer user testing</h2>
          <h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Does click,drag and the sound provide enough feedback?</li>
              <p>
                Most users' feedback are saying the sound provides great
                feedback. Some mention that it lacks visual feedback at this
                stage, especially the red dot.I will think about how to add more
                diverse variations to the red dot(maybe when click the size
                changes). Some feedback mention that it would be great with
                ripples as visual feedback, so considering the visual style of
                ripples is necessary. It is worth noting that since no specific
                ripple appears on the screen, each person's imagined ripple may
                be different. There has not been sufficient feedback in this
                regard. Next time making a prototype, some visual demonstrations
                need to be added and collect feedback. Visual feedback should be
                obvious and attractive to users.
              </p>

              <li>Do the sound create a comfortable or engaging experience?</li>
              <p>
                some feedback suggest that The tone is too sharp and the sound
                doesn't match the expectation for "ripple". I'm considering
                change the tone of the sound, especially the dragging
                sound(someone says it reminds them of a mosquito but I don't
                want that.). Although one of the feedback says that it provides
                surprise and delight, I want the sound and the visual effects to
                stay cohensive. I feel like the tone does provide some fun part
                to this project, but there's quite big differece between
                clicking sound and dragging sound. An interesting discover is
                that some users may prefer surprising feeling, but the feeling
                should partially matches their expectation. It's worthwhile to
                balance these two aspects (How to ensure both the fun factor,
                which against the expectations, and a sense of comfort that
                meets expectations). I notice through other peers' questions
                that different sound can provide different emotions to the
                users. It depends on what atmosphere I want to provide for
                users. I should consider more about the emotion.
